# Workplace_Absenteeism_Project
Following the course "Integrating Python, SQL, and Tableau" (https://adp-gptlearning.udemy.com/course/python-sql-tableau-integrating-python-sql-and-tableau), I continued exploring the Python packages Numpy and Pandas, and I gained exposure to creating ML algorithms with scikit-learn. 
Specifically, this exploration was done using data from a study regarding absenteeism at work and different factors that contribute to it.
